# This is a Makefile.  Its purpose is to create the program “small”.
#
# The rules, below, indicate what depends on what, and how to build
# things when they get out-of-date.  It is VERY important to know that
# what looks like eight leading spaces is really a leading tab
# character.  Leading spaces won’t work--it MUST be a tab character.
#
# For the following questions, do the command if there is one,
# and then answer the question.  If you need another line for you
# answer, continue it on the next line, indented.
#
# As an example, I’ve already answered (1), which has nothing to do
# with anything else in this lab.
#
# Question 1 is worth 0.09 points; questions 2–14 are worth 0.07
# points each.
#
#  1) Command:  date +%A
#     Question: Describe the output of that command.
#     Answer: It’s today’s day of the week.
#
#  2) Command:  make
#     Question: Describe what happens.  Don’t just write the commands;
#     		describe what each command does.
#     Answer: The "make" command reads the Makefile and creates main.o foo.o and the small executable
# 
#  3) Command:  ./small
#     Question: What is the output?  Reproduce the output exactly.
#     Answer: Hi from main at main.cc:15
#	      Hi from foo at foo.cc:14 
#
#  4) Command:  make
#     Question: Why did nothing much happen?
#     Answer: I have already compiled all of the files at this time so there is nothing to change
#
#  5) Command:  rm small; make
#     Question: What got remade, and why?
#     Answer:   Remove the small executable file and re-compiles all of the files
#
#  6) Command:  rm foo.o; make 
#     Question: What got remade, and why?
#     Answer: The foo.o file got re-compiled after it was deleted with the "rm" command
#
#  7) Command:  make clean 
#     Question: What did that do?
#     Answer: it removes all .o files as well as the small executable file
#
#  8) Command:  make 
#     Question: What got remade, and why?
#     Answer: re-compiles all .o files and the small executable, because the previous function "clean" deleted .o and small 
#
#  9) Question: Why does main.o depend on foo.h?
#		I know that it’s because the Makefile says so.
#		Why was that dependency put into the Makefile?
#     Answer: The foo() function is called in main. Therefore main needs to call foo.h. If foo.h changes so does main. This means that main
#             depends on foo.h
#	   
# 10) Command:  Create a new function bar() in bar.cc & bar.h,
# 		similar to foo.cc.  Change main.cc to call the new
# 		bar() function, make sure to #include the proper .h
# 		files everywhere, and type “make”.  Don’t alter Makefile.
#     Question: Why did it fail?
#     Answer: The make failed because bar.h bar.cc main.cc are not called in the MakeFile and some of the files that are needed to compile
#             reference the bar files.  
#
# 11) Command:  Fix the Makefile; verify with “make” until it compiles.
#     Question: Describe your changes.  Don’t just show the changed
#     		lines--describe the purpose of each change.
#     Answer: I added bar.h to main.o as well as bar.o to small and I created bar.o and added bar.h and bar.cc to it.
#	      I had to add each of these files to the MakeFile so that when the program is compiled it can find and read all of the bar files
#             and work with the other functions.
#
# 12) Command:  Uncomment the CXXFLAGS= line, and type “make”.
#     Question: Why didn't anything happen?
#     Answer: All of the object files where previously created and there are no new changes 
#
# 13) Command:  Force a rebuild with: make clean; make 
#     Question: What’s new about the commands executed?
#     Answer: The CXXFLAGS (Warnings and Error Checking) have now been added and now the makefile compiles with those checks applied
#
# 14) Command: 	make clean; ls -l clean
#     Question: The target is “clean”, but no file “clean” got created.
#     		Why not?
#     Answer: "clean" is a function not a file that removes the small executable and all .o files
#
# For extra fame & glory (but no extra points):
#
# 15) Command:  Consult the make manual at
# 		https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html
#		and improve this Makefile by using $@ in the rule
#		that creates “small” itself.

# The CXX variable contains the name of the C++ compiler.  You can’t
# have plus signs in a Make variable, so X is a rotated plus sign.
